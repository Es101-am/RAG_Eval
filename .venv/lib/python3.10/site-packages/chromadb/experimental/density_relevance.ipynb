    "# Density based retrieval relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of using embeddings-based retreival systems like Chroma is knowing whether there are relevant results to a given query in the existing dataset. As application developers, we would like to know when the system doesn't have enough information to complete a given query or task - we want to know what we don't know. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly important in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, since it's [often been observed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00093) that supplying irrelevant context serves to confuse the generative model, leading to the degredation of application performance in ways that are difficult to detect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a relational database which will not return results if none match the query, a vector search based retrieval system will return the $k$ nearest neighbors to any given query, whether they are relevant or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible approach one might take is to tune a distance threshold, and reject any results which fall further away from the query. This might be suitable for certain kind of fixed datasets, but in practice such thresholds tend to be very brittle, and often serve to exclude many relevant results while not always excluding irrelevant ones. Additionally, the threshold will need to be continously adapted as the data changes. Additionally, such distance thresholds are not comparable across embedding models for a given dataset, nor across datasets for a given embedding model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would prefer to find a data driven approach which can:\n",
    "- produce a uniform and comparable measure of relevance for any dataset \n",
    "- automatically adapt as the underlying data changes \n",
    "- is relatively inexpensive to compute\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates one possible such approach, which relies on the distribution of distances (pseudo 'density') between points in a given dataset. For a given result, we use compute the percentile the result's distance to the query falls into with respect to the overall distribution of distances in the dataset. This approach produces a uniform measure of relevance for any dataset, and is relatively cheap to compute, and can be computed online as data mutates. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is still very preliminary, and we welcome contributions and alternative approaches - some ideas are listed at the end of this notebook."

    "Some things to try include:\n",
    "- Construct the distance distribution on the basis of the query-support pairs, rather than between nearest neighbor supports. \n",
    "- Additional evaluations comparing different embedding models for the same dataset, as well as datasets with less redundancy. \n",
    "- Using the distance distribution to deduplicate data, by finding low-percentile outliers. One idea is to use an LLM in the loop to create summaries of document pairs, creating a single point from several which are near one another. \n",
    "- Using relevance as a signal for automatically fine-tuning embedding space. One approach may be to learn an affine transform based on question/answer pairs, to increase the relevance of the correct points relative to others. \n",
