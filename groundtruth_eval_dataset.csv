Threat Model#
Adversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired.

These attacks are considered more challenging due to the discrete nature of text data and the lack of direct gradient signals."

How can large language models (LLMs) be used for classification and what is the concept of finding an adversarial version of an input with imperceptible difference to trigger a different output from the classifier?,"page_content='Classification#
Adversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\mathbf{x}_\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) \neq f(\mathbf{x}_\text{adv})$.

We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via RLHF). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.\nA large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.', 'language': 'en'}","Adversarial attacks on large language models differ from attacks on images in the way they operate.
